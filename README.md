# <p id="about">About</p>

One of the most frustrating activities I had to do from time to time is to search through a pile
of documents to find the one you are looking for. Wouldn't be better to just open an app and type
keywords in the search bar?

That's what this project is for. TLDR: you install a [core](./core) on your PC. Through the
configuration file, you tell it which directory should be watched for new files. Every time new
file appears, core will extract the text from the file and index it.

You also install [client](./client) app on your smartphone. It allows you to list and search
scanned files. It also allows scanning new documents using camera or just pick a PDF.
